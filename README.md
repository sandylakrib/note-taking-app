## Difficulties 

- One of the biggest challenges was switching my codebase from French to English. It created small bugs and confusion, especially with variable names and UI text. In future projects, Iâ€™ll work entirely in English to save time and avoid translation issues.
- Connecting the frontend and backend with authentication (using JWT) was another challenge, especially making sure tokens were stored, verified, and used correctly for protected routes.
- Debugging login issues and displaying helpful error messages taught me more about async/await and API error handling.
- I learned to structure a full-stack app using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and how to build a clean front-end experience with HTML/CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
- I gained valuable experience using Git and GitHub properly, managing environment variables securely, and writing clear documentation.
